## RNA seq Data Analysis for JvRAD study

This repository contains the pipeline for analyzing the RNA seq data for the JvRAD study.


### File Descriptions

The contents of each subdirectory may vary depending on the specific data integration approach. However, common file types you might encounter include:

* **R Markdown Script ( `.Rmd` )**: This file contains the code for data preprocessing, integration analysis, and visualization.
* **Data Files ( `.csv` or `.txt` )**: These files store the raw omics data, such as RNA-Seq counts, proteomics measurements, and DNA methylation levels.
* **Plots ( `.png` )**: These image files depict the results of the analysis, including heatmaps, network plots etc.



### Additional Notes

* This repository is a work in progress, and the contents may be updated as the analysis evolves.
* Refer to the R Markdown script in each subdirectory for more details about the specific data integration approach used.
