# Multi-Omics Data Analysis Project

Welcome to the **Multi-Omics Data Analysis Project** repository! This repository contains scripts, data, and documentation for analyzing various types of omics data. Below is a brief overview of each component:

## 📂 Directory Structure:

1.  **Omics Data Integration:**
    * Contains scripts and documentation for integrating multi-omics datasets. Methods for integration could include statistical techniques, machine learning approaches, or other methodologies tailored to your specific research goals.

2.  **Bulk RNA Seq Analysis:**
    * Here, you'll find scripts and documentation for the analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data. This could involve preprocessing steps such as quality control, alignment, differential expression analysis, pathway analysis, and visualization.

3.  **DNA Methylation Analysis:**
    * This directory contains scripts and documentation for analyzing DNA methylation data. It may include preprocessing steps, differential methylation analysis, identification of differentially methylated regions (DMRs), and functional annotation.

4.  **Microbiome Data Analysis with Qiime 2:**
    * Qiime 2 is a powerful tool for microbiome data analysis. In this folder, you'll find scripts and documentation specific to Qiime 2 workflows, including preprocessing, taxonomic classification, diversity analysis, and visualization.

5.  **Proteomics Data Analysis:**
    * This directory includes scripts and documentation for the analysis of proteomics data. It could involve preprocessing steps, protein identification, quantification, differential expression analysis, and functional enrichment analysis.

## 🚀 Usage:

* Each subdirectory contains its own `README.md` file with detailed instructions on how to use the scripts and data provided within.
* Before running any scripts, please ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed and configured appropriately.

## 🤝 Contributing:

* Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have improvements, bug fixes, or additional analyses to contribute, please feel free to submit a pull request.
