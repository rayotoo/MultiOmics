# Multi-Omics Data Analysis Project

Welcome to the Multi-Omics Data Analysis project repository! This repository contains scripts, data, and documentation for analyzing various types of omics data. Below is a brief overview of each component:

## Directory Structure:

1. **Omics Data Integration:**
   - This folder contains scripts and documentation for integrating multi-omics data sets. Methods for integration could include statistical techniques, machine learning approaches, or other methodologies tailored to your specific research goals.

2. **Bulk RNA Seq Analysis:**
   - Here, you'll find scripts and documentation for the analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data. This could involve preprocessing steps such as quality control, alignment, differential expression analysis, pathway analysis, and visualization.

3. **DNA Methylation Analysis:**
   - This directory contains scripts and documentation for analyzing DNA methylation data. It may include preprocessing steps, differential methylation analysis, identification of differentially methylated regions (DMRs), and functional annotation.

4. **Microbiome Data Analysis with Qiime 2:**
   - Qiime 2 is a powerful tool for microbiome data analysis. In this folder, you'll find scripts and documentation specific to Qiime 2 workflows, including preprocessing, taxonomic classification, diversity analysis, and visualization.

5. **Proteomics Data Analysis:**
   - This directory includes scripts and documentation for the analysis of proteomics data. It could involve preprocessing steps, protein identification, quantification, differential expression analysis, and functional enrichment analysis.

## Usage:
- Each subdirectory contains its own README file with detailed instructions on how to use the scripts and data provided within.
- Before running any scripts, please ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed and configured appropriately.

## Contributing:
- Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have improvements, bug fixes, or additional analyses to contribute, please feel free to submit a pull request.

## License:
- This project is licensed under the XXX. See the LICENSE file for details.

## Contact:
- For questions, concerns, or feedback regarding this project, please contact raotoo@uams.edu.

We hope you find this repository helpful for your omics data analysis endeavors!
